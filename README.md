# Project part 1 
This part is focused on having students determine which star is closest to others while moving to look at the perspective movement of the stars.

Task list for part 1:

Display the order of the stars closest to farthest as each one is selected. (Sam)

Change Score UI to misses (Vanessa)

move the player to the center of the constellation once the player has completed it. (Cory)

Place a model of the sun at 1/3 of the players height (Peter)

tilt the skybox to the correct angle. (Carter)

# Project part 2
This part is focused on showing the ellipse like movement of stars viewed from earth to determine their distance from the player

Task list for part 2:

instead of the stars moving in a circle, the player should move in a circle.

add more stars at a variety of distances and angles from the player. ie horizontal to vertical

place a stationary model of the sun at the center of the players orbit

place a model of the earth beneath the player at roughly their knees

click and hold the trigger to use angle tool instead of pressing twice

Display a fan when the angle tool is being used.
