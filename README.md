spawn the constellations in front of the player at eye level
increase collider size on stars as they get further away
arrange constellations sequentially
tilt the skybox to the correct angle.

# Project part 2
This part is focused on showing the ellipse like movement of stars viewed from earth to determine their distance from the player

Task list for part 2:

create a protractor tool that can measure the angle between to points on a stars ellipse
add player ability to turn star trails on and off
make the stars in the scene equal
